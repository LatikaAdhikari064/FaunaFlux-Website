This project aims to build a comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Platform leveraging Vultr's cloud infrastructure, designed to monitor, analyze, and safeguard biodiversity in real time. The platform integrates IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, and data analytics tools to deliver actionable insights into wildlife populations, habitat health, and environmental threats.

The goal is to empower researchers, conservationists, and policymakers with a centralized and intelligent solution to improve wildlife protection efforts, support data-driven decision-making, and optimize conservation strategies.

Key Features
⭐Real-time Wildlife Tracking: Uses IoT sensors to monitor species population, movement, and habitat conditions.
⭐Behavioral Analysis: AI models analyze animal behavior for deeper insights into species adaptation and stress signals.
⭐Extinction Alerts: Predictive analytics send early warnings to help prevent species from going extinct.
⭐Climate Impact Assessment: Evaluates how climate change is affecting wildlife and their ecosystems.
⭐Community Engagement: Promotes collaboration between local communities, researchers, and conservation authorities for effective conservation.
⭐Data-Driven Insights: Centralized dashboard for researchers and policymakers to access actionable biodiversity data.
